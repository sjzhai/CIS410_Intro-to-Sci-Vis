Files in this directory:

tricase.cxx: This should be the only file you modify.  
    You should implement your proj6B.cxx to include this file and use its triangle cases.
    As the cases get added, your final isosurface will get more and more correct.
    You should commit your changes using SVN when you have finished your cases.

proj6B.vtk: The file to use to make your screenshot for project turn in.

TriangleList.h: A header file that your proj6B.cxx should use to create the final surface.
    It takes the place of SegmentList from Project 6A.

screenshot.png: The screenshot I took.  Keep in mind that I made this picture with the
    master marching cubes table.  If our crowdsourced table doesn't have all the cases 
    (or if some aren't correct), then your proj6B.cxx could be 100% correct but still
    produce a different picture.

test_data.vtk:  This file exhibits every case in the marching cubes table.


Files not in this directory:

proj6B.cxx: you will create this from your proj6A.cxx and extend it to 3D.
